            Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian breakfast of crispy crepes made with ground rice and lentil batter that is fermented. With just a handful of ingredients learn to make the classic Dosa recipe from scratch with my easy video and step-by-step photos. I also cover making your own dosa batter in a blender or mixer-grinder, tips on fermentation and cooking dosa to help you make the best dosa – crispy, soft and so good to dunk in a bowl of Coconut Chutney or piping hot Sambar.

            learn how to make dosa in 10 steps
        </h2>
        <h2>
            step 1
        </h2>
        <p>
             In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice 

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 2
        </h2>
        <p>
            To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 3
        </h2>
        <p>
            Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep them aside.
        </p>
        <h2>
            step 4
        </h2>
        <p>
            Add 1.5 cups of water and mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 5
        </h2>
        <p>
            Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients to a mixer grinder or a blender.

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 6
        </h2>
        <p>
            Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. The time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions, climate and altitude.

            In winters, the time of fermentation can go up to 14 to 24 hours. If you live in a cold city or high altitude then I highly recommend fermenting the batter in an Instant pot if you have one.

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 7
        </h2>
        <p>
            Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan with a spoon or with a thick paper towel dipped in oil. For a richer taste, you can cook the dosa with ghee or butter.

Note that the oil should be spread evenly or else it becomes difficult to spread the batter. If the pan is well seasoned you don’t need to spread oil. I suggest keeping a separate skillet or tawa to make only dosa.
        </p>
        <h2>
            step 8
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now take a ladle full of the dosa batter or about ¼ cup of the batter. Pour the batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards. In the below photo you will see a well-spread dosa batter.

        </p>
        <h2>
            step 9
        </h2>
       <p>
        Cook the dosa on low to medium heat. Do regulate the heat as per the pan size and thickness. You can even cover the dosa with a lid and let it get cooked from the bottom as I do.


       </p>
       <h2>
        step 10
       </h2>
       <p>
        When the dosa has nicely browned from the bottom and the surface looks well cooked, soft without any specks of undercooked batter, then fold with a spatula and lift it from the pan.

        Serve Dosa hot with coconut chutney, potato masala and sambar. It is best to serve these crispy dosa hot.
